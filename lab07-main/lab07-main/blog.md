## Task 1 Composite Pattern
- Q1: Compound nodes: and, or, not. Leaf node: a boolean value
- Q2: I will use interface to represent the composite type

## Task 2 Factory Pattern
- Q3: The different objects that we need to create is all boolean nodes such as not, or , and with differrent field such as subnode and boolean value

## Task: Random
- Approach: Execute a large number of battle() calls and use assertions to verify that the proportion of true and false results is close to 50%. This helps ensure the random number generation behaves as expected over a larger sample size.
